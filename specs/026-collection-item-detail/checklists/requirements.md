# Specification Quality Checklist: Collection Item Detail View

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

Key assumptions documented in spec:

- Seller website URL column existence in DB is assumed but unconfirmed (FR-007 conditionally deferred)
- Navigation active state relies on prefix-based path matching for both `/my-collection` and `/collection/*`
- Old `/models/[...modelId]` route is treated as internal-only, allowing simple removal or redirect
